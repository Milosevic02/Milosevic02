### Experience and Competitions
- üèÜ First place in a hackathon on convolutional neural networks.
- ü•à Second place in the IEEE-4 Challenge competition.
- üåü Currently participating in the BOSCH FUTURE CHALLENGE.

### Additional University Courses:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Various Mathematics (discrete, algebra, analysis, optimization methods,etc.)
- Algorithms (searches, sorts,etc.)
- Databases (SQL, ER Models)
- Compilers (Learning about compiler operation and construction)
- Modeling and Simulation
- Concurrent Programming
- Agile Software Development (SOLID principles, Scrum methodology)
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- Electrical Engineering, Electric Power Engineering
- Computer Networks (Client-Server Communication)

### Areas of Interest
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Backend, and Data science. While I possess a solid grasp of frontend development, my inclination leans towards problem-solving rather than styling. Nevertheless, I have immersed myself in frontend development to attain a comprehensive understanding of web development as a whole.

### Personal Traits
I enjoy teamwork, as confirmed by my participation in two competitions during my second year of college. In addition to winning prizes at these competitions, I have gained valuable knowledge and new connections. I continue to explore different areas of software engineering, both through my university studies and independently.
